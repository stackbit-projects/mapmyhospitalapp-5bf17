MapMyHospital allows patients to book consults, chat and share medical documents with their doctors. Doctors can see all their appointments and patient details on a single dashboard. We aim to make it easy and intuitive for patients and doctors to interact and build a long lasting relationship.

## Work Life Balance

Our goal is for work and life to be managed in one place, to help you maintain a zen state of mind.

> "Tasks and deadlines should not control our time. We should control what when to pay attention to which task." -- Lorinda Mamo, Designer

With MapMyHospital, we strive to make it clear and easy to follow a healthy routine of work effectiveness, collaboration, and also make time for being yourself.

## We Value Your YOU Time

Our team understands that life is a marathon, and it's super important to make sure you take care of YOU and your needs. We give you the tools to finally clear your schedule, and manage your appointments as easy as drag-and-drop.
