Here’s how you can have a successful practice:

### My practice, my rules

You are your own boss, so use that
autonomy to dictate your own processes. Use your best judgement to setup administrative
processes the way they make sense to you. It does mean you alone are
responsible when things don’t work out, but that’s an opportunity for you to
learn better and faster than any courses you’ve been through.

### Do I need an MBA now?

NO, you don’t. But you do need to
know how to market yourself. Set yourself apart from others by maintaining a
definitive brand, clearly communicating your value proposition to patients, and
delivering on your promise. TIP: pick a niche, be the best at it, and grow from
there.

### Pick your team, Captain

You’ve won the toss, but you can do
this all alone. Get the best people you know on board, and build your A-team of
support staff, nurses, and administrators. Even if they’re not very experienced,
look for talented, and driven people. If you get the right people by your side,
doesn’t matter where you want to go, you’ll get there.
